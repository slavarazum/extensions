Daily notes are date-based documents. Tasks have scopes: inbox (unscheduled), active (due), upcoming (scheduled), logbook (completed). Collections are structured data tables within documents. Always use get-collection-schema before adding items to understand the structure. Don't show entities IDs to users unless specifically requested."
